		<h1> Subject </h1>
		<p> The subejct of this lab was to help orgainze and exlpore the file struture given to us while also testing it to see how to see how it works </P>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> some diffuclties included connecting our css files to connect to our index files. also the instrutions were personaly hard to understand escaplly when I would do the exact thing it says yet nothing would work. For example it doesnt state that the site.css needs to be out side of its folder and a sibling to the index for it work. I learned that by just trial and error </p>

		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p> after some diffculty, we were able to create stable code that can be easliy modfied to fit our page's needs </p>
